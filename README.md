# 💎 Glassmorphic Scientific Calculator
 A beautifully crafted, high-performance Scientific Calculator built with a modern Glassmorphism design. This project features a transparent UI with real-time backdrop blur, dynamic decimal precision, and a fully responsive layout.
 🚀 Features:
            Glassmorphic UI: Transparent "frosted glass" effect using backdrop-filter.
            Scientific Suite: Includes Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), Logarithms (log, ln), Square Root, Power ($x^y$), and Factorials ($n!$).
            Dynamic Precision: Automatically adjusts decimal places based on input  while eliminating floating-point errors.
            Tactile Feedback: Buttons highlight and scale down upon clicking to provide a physical feel.

            Branded Footer: Custom-styled footer with a glowing red heart.
 🛠️ Built With:
            HTML5: Semantic structure and mathematical character support.
            CSS3: Custom properties, Flexbox/Grid, and backdrop-filter for the glass effect.
            JavaScript (ES6): Custom mathematical logic, recursion for factorials, and dynamic rounding.
